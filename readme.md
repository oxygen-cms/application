# Oxygen CMS Starter Application

This repository contains a simple starter application for Oxygen. It includes all Oxygen-made extensions and provides a great starting point for using Oxygen as a Content Management System.

## Installation

Firstly, Oxygen CMS has a few system requirements. Most of these are inherited from the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/installation).

- PHP >= 5.5.9
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension

Oxygen utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. So, before using Oxygen, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

To download the starter application and set up dependencies, run the following command:

    composer create-project oxygen/application --prefer-dist
